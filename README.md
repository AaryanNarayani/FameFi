# FameFi
Trade the stardom of celebrities, where fame meets finance in the ultimate decentralised marketplace.

# Idea

**FameFi** is a decentralized platform that empowers public figures—such as athletes, actors, musicians, politicians, and other influencers—to tokenize their personal brands on the Solana blockchain. Each celebrity can create their own branded cryptocurrency, such as "CR7Coin" for Cristiano Ronaldo or "KiratSol" for Harkirat Singh. These tokens, known as CelebrityCoins, are unique digital assets that fans and investors can trade on our platform. The value of CelebrityCoins fluctuates based on the celebrity's real-world actions, achievements, and public perception, creating a dynamic and engaging market that reflects the true essence of fame.
